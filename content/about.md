Welcome to my corner of the web! 🎩✨

- I'm Suyash Salvi, a Computer Science & Engineering graduate with an eye for detail and a
  passion for weaving magic through code. ✨🎩
- You can find my technical skills and more in the CV section. 💻📄 
- Having traversed the landscapes of Santa Clara, CA, and Mumbai, India, 🌏 I've cultivated a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and experiences. 
- While beyond the realms of technology, I find joy in activities such as hitting the gym 💪, dancing to the rhythm of life 💃, strumming melodies on my guitar 🎸, diving into the depths of spirituality 🧘‍♂️, and getting lost in the pages of a good book 📚.
